The codes base on Dahlen's theory and apply to compact stars.
"Earth" is the test code which run with "EM.xlsx" and it gives similar figures with Dahlen's work. It shows the reliability of our codes.

"NEU" means the two-layers model and "STR" means the solid model.
"strain" calculate the dislocation, strain and stress caused by spin-down.
"Gamma" calculate the Gamma which is the proportion of inertia change and seismic moment.
"Dinertia" calculate the inertia change caused by unit seismic moment with optimal parameters. "Dinertia" should run with the "di1""di2""di3" calculate by"Gamma".
